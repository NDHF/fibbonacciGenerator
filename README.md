# fibbonacciGenerator
A simple function for printing the Fibbonacci sequence

1. This function takes three arguments: two starting numbers, and a number to stop at. Using recursion, the numbers are added together, and the function is called again, using the second number and the new, third number. When the first two numbers are 1 and 1, the function will generate the Fibbonacci sequence up to the specified stopping point. 

2. Future Improvements: I would like to add some error-catching conditionals. These would ensure that the arguments used are whole integers, or undefined. If undefined, they should default to 1 and 1 for the numbers, and 100 for the stopping point.
